Students - FORK this to your own account and then clone down to your local machine. Use the **starter-code** branch to code along with the video. You can also reference the **solution** branch to study my code.

Initially when you open the project in VSCode on your local computer, you will be in the main/master branch. Use the command 'git branch' in the terminal to view all available branches as shown below:

If you wish to reference the solution, you can switch to that branch anytime as well.
